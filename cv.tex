\section{publications}

I published my first paper before graduation: 

\cite{merelo88} 
and my first paper in a journal a few years
afterwards, getting already into parallel computing:

\cite{parallel90}
I was working for a few years applying Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map to protein structure prediction

\cite{jjproteng} 
and it hit pay dirt, since 20 years after it gathers
several hundred references (and growing). Let's not dwell in the past
and talk about current developments. I was PhD advisor for JLJ Laredo,
who continued with DREAM development. This paper is a good example of
our work in the area.

\cite{evag:gpem}
but his work raised several issues about how asynchronous distributed
evolutionaory computing worked, which we addressed in this paper in
which I am the first author.

\cite{jj:2008:PPSN}
problems similar to what we found in our work on browser-based
evolutionary algorithms.

\cite{agajaj}
long before browser-based botnets were discovered. I also started to
work with the Mastermind Puzzle in 1996.

\cite{jj-ppsn96}
setting the state of the art several times until today. Our latest hints at 
literary engineering.
