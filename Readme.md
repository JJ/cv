# JJ's short 2-page CV

Below this is the original README for the template I'm using. While I'm at it, I'll throw in a few things you probably will have to install before using it

* This template uses XeLaTeX, not the standard LaTeX. So `sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex`
* Besides, XeLaTeX seems to use `biber`, not BibTeX. So `sudo apt-get install biber`
* Default font has been changed to Goudy BookLetter 1911. You'll have
  to install if (`ttf-goudybookletter` package). I took out XITS Math but the fallback font was not
  instaled either, so you'll have to install it.
* You will also have to install `texlive-fonts-extra` and `texlive-math-extra` 

Sounds like hard work for a resum√©, right? Well, you will have to do
it only once and then you can use all the time you want. I haven't
managed to make it work for older versions of Ubuntu, though.

That's it.

## About
Latest version of my CV, typesetted in Helvetica and using colors inspired by Monokai (there is an `print` option which renders in black and white, and reverts the header to dark on light, if printing on paper is needed).

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Helvetica Neue, biblatex to print my publications and textpos for the aside.
